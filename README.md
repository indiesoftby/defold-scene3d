# Scene3D - make 3D games with Defold

Scene3D is a collection of assets to help you developing 3D games with the Defold game engine. Use included prefabs to quickly prototype structures, levels, and to test game mechanics. Try out ideas quickly!

The built-in example scene is available [‚ú®**to play online**‚ú®](https://indiesoftby.github.io/defold-scene3d/). Controls:
- `WASD` to run or drive, `SPACE` to jump. Mouse to look. `4` to switch between character/car.
- Special keys: `5` to reload current scene, `6` to load next scene, `0` to toggle photo mode (move the mouse to look, `WASD` to fly, `SPACE` to go up, `C` to go down, `M` to copy camera settings).
- In the debug build: `1` to toggle physics debug, `2` to toggle profiler.

## Key features

* [x] Car physics.
* [x] Character controller.
* [x] Controls: keyboard, mouse look with a pointer lock.
* [x] Frustum culling for 3D meshes. **Note: now it's better to use Defold's built-in frustum culling.**

### Included Assets (i.e. Prefabs)

* [x] Camera. Options: clear color, FOV, near clip, far clip.
    * [x] First-person mouse-look with a pointer lock support.
    * [x] Orbit camera script to follow an object in a third-person view.
* [x] Directional Light. Options: ambient color, intensity, light direction, fog color, fog range.
* [x] Chunked Floor. Spawns objects from a factory to make an "infinite" world around an object.
* [x] Late Update. It calls your scripts after all `update` functions have been called and physics objects have been moved.
* [ ] [Request more](https://github.com/indiesoftby/defold-scene3d/issues/new?template=content-request.md) or [contribute](#contributing-to-scene3d).

#### Debugging

#### Buildings

* [x] Floor: 1x1, 2x2, 5x5, 10x10.

* [x] Walls with door frames.
* [x] Walls with window frames.
* [x] Stairs 1x1.
* [x] Ramps 1x1, 3x3, 1x2, 3x6.

#### Environment

* [x] Letters A-Z, numbers 0-9.

#### Primitives

* [x] Cone.
* [x] Cube.
* [x] Cylinder.

#### Visual Effects

* [x] Blob shadows (implemented as projected 2D sprites).

#### Materials

* [x] `basic_color.material` - colors your model + the simplest shading. The mesh should have the "color" stream.
* [x] `basic_grid_*.material` - it puts a texture on your objects without having to make UV‚Äôs.
* [x] `basic_unlit.material` - the simplest possible textured material. `sky.material` is the same but with a different tag.
* [x] `primitive_*.material` - no textures, only applies tint on your model.

Some materials have a tint from the palette: ![#687378](https://via.placeholder.com/15/687378/000000?text=+) Nickel, ![#d9d9d3](https://via.placeholder.com/15/d9d9d3/000000?text=+) Timberwolf, ![#38b2cb](https://via.placeholder.com/15/38b2cb/000000?text=+) Pacific Blue, ![#0baaad](https://via.placeholder.com/15/0baaad/000000?text=+) Verdigris, ![#94d2bd](https://via.placeholder.com/15/94d2bd/000000?text=+) Middle Blue Green, ![#e9d8a6](https://via.placeholder.com/15/e9d8a6/000000?text=+) Medium Champagne, ![#ffcd70](https://via.placeholder.com/15/ffcd70/000000?text=+) Maximum Yellow Red, ![#fd905e](https://via.placeholder.com/15/fd905e/000000?text=+) Atomic Tangerine, ![#ef766b](https://via.placeholder.com/15/ef766b/000000?text=+) Salmon, ![#e2797d](https://via.placeholder.com/15/e2797d/000000?text=+) Candy Pink.

Included shaders don't apply [gamma correction](https://learnopengl.com/Advanced-Lighting/Gamma-Correction).

## Current Status

‚ö†Ô∏è **Work in progress** ‚ö†Ô∏è

* ‚úîÔ∏è It's suitable for production, but be aware that API, scripts, project structure aren't in a finished state and may be changed.
* ‚úîÔ∏è If you are making the game with Scene3D, follow the optimization section below before releasing your game.

## How To Use

### Before You Start

Scene3D uses the metric system, i.e. metres as its default unit for measuring distance/length, i.e. 1 unit is 1 meter.

* Coordinate system: [OpenGL, i.e. a right-handed system](https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Coordinate-Systems) - the positive x-axis is to your right, the positive y-axis is up and the positive z-axis is backwards. The forward direction is `vmath.vector3(0, 0, -1)`.

### Installation

Use it in your own project by adding this project as a [Defold library dependency](http://www.defold.com/manuals/libraries/). Open your `game.project` file and in the dependencies field under project [add the link to **the ZIP file**](https://github.com/indiesoftby/defold-scene3d/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

#### Required Dependencies

* [Pointer Lock](https://github.com/indiesoftby/defold-pointer-lock) (only if a project uses `mouse_look.script` or the `debug_ui.collection` prefab).

#### Optional Dependencies

Scene3D can use the following dependencies if you include them in your project:

* [Clipboard](https://github.com/britzl/defold-clipboard).
* [Screenshot](https://github.com/britzl/defold-screenshot).

### Included Scenes

* [x] `playground`: a playable level with a first-person character controller and a car. Loaded first.
* [x] `basic_3d`: use it as a template to start developing a new 3D project/scene.
* [x] `shadows`: a scene to test shadows.

## Contributing to Scene3D

üëçüéâ First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! üéâüëç

Scene3D tries to follow the principles:

* **Developer-friendly:** it should be user-friendly and have a comfortable learning curve to make it a good choice for developers of any experience.
* **Mobile-friendly:** it should be able to run on mobile and web platforms.
* **Ready-to-use:** the included components should be ready for production.

When creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible. If you find a Closed issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

Please, follow code formatting style of the project:

* The default indentation is **4 spaces** for the all code, i.e. Lua, C++, HTML/CSS/JS, GLSL. Who prefer to use tabs to indent code, configure [git to automatically switch between spaces and tabs](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2316677/can-git-automatically-switch-between-spaces-and-tabs/2318063#2318063).
* Use `snake_case` when naming files, Lua variables, objects, functions, and instances.
* This [Lua Style Guide](https://github.com/Olivine-Labs/lua-style-guide) mostly suits the project well.
